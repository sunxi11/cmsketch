    Insert the provided key or hash values into the count-min sketch X number of times.

        x           -   The number of times to insert the key; if this parameter
                        is not present in the function then it is 1
        hashes      -   A set of hashes that represent the key to insert; very
                        useful when adding the same element to many count-min
                        sketches. This is only provieded if key is not.
        num_hashes  -   The number of hashes in the hash array
    Returns:
        On Success  -   The number of times `key` or `hashes` that have been
                        inserted using `min` estimation;
                        NOTE: result can be negative!
